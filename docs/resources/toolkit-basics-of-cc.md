Narrative Statement
---------------------

Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that enables the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools. Our free, easy-to-use copyright licenses provide a simple, standardized way to give the public permission to share and use your creative work --- on conditions of your choice. CC licenses let you easily change your copyright terms from the default of "all rights reserved" to "some rights reserved." Creative Commons licenses are not an alternative to copyright. They work alongside copyright and enable you to modify your copyright terms to best suit your needs. We've collaborated with intellectual property experts around the world to ensure that our licenses work globally.

### What is Creative Commons?

Creative Commons (CC) is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous, standardized terms, those who want to make creative uses of works, and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis.

### Is CC against copyright?

Absolutely not. Creative Commons licenses are copyright licenses, and depend on the existence of copyright to work. CC licenses simply help creators extend reuse and remixing rights of their creative work to the public.

### What do CC licenses allow you to do?

Creative Commons licenses are legal tools that creators and other rightsholders can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving other rights. The six Creative Commons licenses provide a simple vocabulary for what would otherwise be a complicated agreement between creator and licensee. By selecting a license, copyright holders choose which rights they'd like to keep and what types of reuse to allow.
